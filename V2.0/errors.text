Arrow Smaller, less bright in the start level, move up significantly. Less bright. 
Instead of replay level in the end screen, say replay game, please also then clear the start progress of start level because that still does not work
For the biodome intro move the press e to confirm part higher so its in the box
The Terra vault should not be optional, remove the try anyway, and just have them proceed to the terravault
Finally in the ecology level, make the submit button less bright on hover (also see if its possibly to make the box a bit better designed in terms of style, for example the bottom box after the do not pour text, could be moved more to the left, including the . with it)
Also once a soil water or light have been submitted its every hard to change, maybe press e again to unsubmit the choice so they can fix their mistake
