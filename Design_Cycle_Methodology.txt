PROMPT ACADEMY: DESIGN CYCLE & METHODOLOGY
"Generate...Summarize...Create" - AI Behavior Educational Game
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
An interactive educational game teaching students (ages 10-13) how system
prompts shape AI behavior through narrative-driven puzzles and real AI-powered
characters.

DESIGN CYCLE PHASES

1. EMPATHIZE & DEFINE
   • Target Audience: Middle school students (10-13 years old)
   • Problem: Abstract AI concepts (system prompts, context) are difficult
     to understand
   • Solution: Make AI behavior tangible through interactive gameplay with
     real LLM-powered characters
   • Learning Goals: System prompt awareness, sequential logic, precise
     communication

2. IDEATE & PLAN
   • Initial brainstorming documented in design proposals and drafts
   • Character personas defined: Ratio (grumpy guide), GARY (helpful robot),
     Bio-Bot (emotional gardener)
   • Progressive level design: Tutorial → Component Assembly → Prompt
     Fill-in-the-Blanks
   • Technical architecture: HTML5 Canvas + Serverless Functions + LLM API

3. PROTOTYPE
   • V1.0 "Persona Playground": Simple chatbot proof-of-concept with 4
     personality types
   • Isolated test environments: movement_system_test.html, clanker_test.html,
     game_save.html
   • Component testing before integration
   • Rapid iteration to validate core mechanics

4. DEVELOP & ITERATE
   • V2.0 "Prompt Academy": Full game with 3 levels (4,046+ lines of code)
   • 30+ git commits showing iterative refinement cycle
   • Major iterations: Save system fixes, aspect ratio adjustments, dialogue
     rewrites, music integration
   • Context-aware AI system with dynamic responses via Groq API (llama-3.1-8b)
   • Security implementation: API keys hidden in Netlify serverless backend

5. TEST & REFINE
   • Analytics logging system to track player interactions and mistakes
   • User feedback integration: Simplified language, visual feedback
     (happy/sad states), progressive hints
   • Bug fix cycles documented in commit history
   • Cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization (5-min caching)

6. DEPLOY & EVALUATE
   • Production deployment on Netlify with continuous delivery pipeline
   • Separate deployment branch for staging/production workflow
   • Live demo accessible at technejad.github.io/chatbot_demo
   • Ongoing refinements based on real-world usage

KEY DESIGN ELEMENTS

Technology Stack:
• Frontend: Pure JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas (no frameworks), CSS3
• Backend: Netlify Serverless Functions, Groq API with key rotation
• Data: LocalStorage for game state persistence

Educational Methodology:
• Learning by Doing: Hands-on experimentation with immediate feedback
• Scaffolded Difficulty: Tutorial guidance → Independent problem-solving
• Safe Failure Environment: Retry mechanisms, no permanent consequences
• Narrative Engagement: Fantasy academy setting motivates learning

Innovation:
• Real AI Dialogue: Characters respond dynamically using LLM (not scripted)
• Context-Aware System Prompts: Same AI behaves differently per game context
• Visual Feedback Loops: Character emotions reflect prompt accuracy
• Progressive Complexity: From simple door puzzle to multi-stage germination

IMPACT & OUTCOMES
• Successfully transformed abstract AI concepts into accessible, engaging
  gameplay for middle school students
• Demonstrated complete iterative design cycle from initial concept through
  prototyping to production deployment
• Achieved measurable learning objectives through real-world AI integration
  with dynamic LLM-powered characters
